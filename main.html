    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the time required to run an algorithm as a function of the input size. An efficient algorithm minimizes the time complexity to ensure faster execution.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm as a function of the input size. It is important to understand how efficiently an algorithm uses memory, and a common way to express this is by using Big-O notation, such as O(n).</p>
